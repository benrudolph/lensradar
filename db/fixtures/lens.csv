Of the 23 elements in seven moving groups, seven are made from glasses with anomalous partial dispersion for the minimisation of chromatic aberrations. The movement of the two focusing elements is provided by a newly developed drive concept with linear positioning of the lenses by stepping motors. A special feature of this is that the overall length of the lens does not change when either focusing or zooming. The lens hood supplied with the lens suppresses undesirable reflections and stray light. The lens also has a removable tripod plate for attaching it to a tripod. Its ergonomic design makes the lens easier to carry by hand and allows the attachment of a lens belt. A lockable rotating tripod collar allows the lens to be fixed at any angle. The collar has detents every 90 degrees for rapid switching from landscape to portrait form"

It is the successor to the famous Leica Noctilux-M 50 mm f/1 ASPH., which was added to the product range in 1975. Thanks to state-of-the-art optics and mechanical technologies, Leica has succeeded in achieving substantial improvements over the previous model. With nearly identical dimensions, a noticeable increase in lens speed has been achieved. The extremely shallow depth of field (DOF) at open aperture produces portraits and detailed studies of unequalled aesthetic effect. Even when just slightly stopped down, the result is outstanding image quality, comparable to the Leica Summilux-M 50 mm f/1.4 ASPH, which is considered the best standard lens ever produced. When used in available light photography, the lens exceeds the perception of the human eye. Even the light from one candle can be sufficient for handheld photography.

On full-frame bodies it's a useful ultra-wide angle zoom, and offers very good central sharpness at all apertures, improving upon stopping down. Edges are rough though, and don't really ever sharpen up, and heavy vignetting is impossible to ignore between F2.8-4. At this point in time, the 17-35mm F2.8 stands as a solid, no-nonsense lens that will take a lot of abuse, but optically it has been roundly surpassed by the AF-S Nikkor 14-24mm f/2.8G ED and the more practical, but slower AF-S Nikkor 16-35mm f/4G ED VR."

A favorite among photojournalists for many years now, the 80-200mm's appeal lies in its excellent optical quality, even 'wide open' at F2.8, and these days, its low cost relative to newer optically stabilized telephoto zooms is impossible to ignore. If you can live without VR and SWD focus (and a minimum focus distance of 1.5m) the 80-200mm F2.8D is definitely worthy of consideration, but if you can afford it, the current AF-S Nikkor 70-200mm F2.8G ED VR II is a better lens all-round."

Engineers are free to innovate in an uncommon atmosphere where optical performance comes before price, resulting in lenses that satisfy the demands of discerning photographers. Extreme photographic conditions call for extreme, specialized optics. Distant and elusive wildlife, birding, team sports, motorsports and surveillance are just a few of the photographic conditions that demand both zoom versatility and extreme telephoto power. APS-C-sensor photographers will enjoy super-telephoto magnification, with a picture angle range approximating a 310-775mm lens on a 35mm film or full-frame DSLR. Featuring LD (Low Dispersion Glass) to combat chromatic aberrations and an Internal Focus mechanism that maintains a fixed barrel length when focusing, the SP 200-500mm provides high telephoto magnification accompanied by the sought-after perspective compression effect that draws even greater attention to subjects. While not a small lens, when compared to other similar focal lengths, the SP 200-500mm is an easy choice for outdoor enthusiasts who often must hike great distances with their gear, in search of their subjects."

A focal length of 180mm, 1:1 (life-size) macro reproduction, a fast, constant F3.5 maximum aperture and an optical formula featuring two LD (Low Dispersion) glass elements combine in a lens perfectly suited for extreme close-up shooting with an extended front element-to-subject working distance. The SP 180mm F/3.5 Di's characteristics also lend themselves to indoor, close-range sports shooting and beautiful environmental portraiture. A special FEC (Filter Effect Control) function reintroduces ease to the use of a polarizing filter. Canon and Nikon mount-variants feature a focus ring with instantaneous switching between auto and manual focus for fine-focus adjustment."
